Test Plan Outline: Amazon-like E-commerce Website

This section outlines a test plan for an e-commerce website similar to Amazon. It covers:

Test Objectives:
Verify core functionalities (search, browsing, checkout, etc.)
Ensure user experience aligns with Amazon standards
Identify and document defects
Assess website performance under varying loads
Validate compatibility across browsers, devices, and OSes
Scope:
Functional testing of core features
Usability testing for user experience
Compatibility testing across platforms
Performance testing under normal and peak loads
Security testing (password strength, data encryption, payment security)
Integration testing with payment gateways and shipping providers
Test Deliverables:
Test plan document
Detailed test cases and test scripts
Test execution reports
Defect reports
Test summary report

Automated Test Scripts

The following sections demonstrate automated test scripts for various scenarios:

Login Automation using C# and Selenium WebDriver: This script automates login to a demo website and validates success/failure based on credentials in a CSV file.
API Testing with Postman and JSON Path Expressions: This section explains how to use Postman to send a GET request, extract data using JSON Path expressions, and print the extracted value.
Performance Testing Concepts: This section describes key steps involved in performance testing and lists performance metrics to monitor during load testing.
BDD Scenario for Testing Search Functionality: This presents a BDD scenario written in Gherkin syntax to test the search functionality on an e-commerce website.
Regression Testing Strategy for Word Processing Software: This explains key areas and techniques for regression testing a word processing software.
Smoke Testing and Sanity Testing Concepts: This section defines and differentiates between smoke testing and sanity testing.
Data-Driven Login Test Script using C# and Selenium WebDriver (Similar to Login Automation): This script demonstrates data-driven testing by using a CSV file for login credentials.
NUnit Test Cases for a C# Math Library: This section provides NUnit test cases to validate the correctness of addition and subtraction functions in a C# library.
TypeScript Script for Web App Login and Profile Validation using Protractor: This script automates login to a web application using TypeScript and Protractor, then validates the profile information.
TypeScript Script for API Testing using SuperTest: This script demonstrates using TypeScript and SuperTest to send a GET request to a public API and validate the response.
